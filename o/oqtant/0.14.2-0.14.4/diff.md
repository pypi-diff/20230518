 # Tutorial Notebooks
 
-Getting started with Oqtant is easy using the tutorial notebooks (your Oqtant installation already includes the latest version of Jupyter Notebook). These tutorials will walk you through the basic functions of using Oqtant to interact with the Albert hardware. Feel free to use these as a starting point for your own code: edit, rename, shareâ€¦ they are yours.

-## Running Tutorial Notebooks
+## Downloading Tutorial Notebooks
 
-Once Oqtant and it's dependencies have successfully been installed into your python virtual environment you can now open and use the provided tutorial notebooks. If you downloaded Oqtant from [https://albert-dev.coldquanta.com](https://albert-dev.coldquanta.com) you can find the tutorial notebooks inside of the same folder as the Oqtant `.whl` file in the `documentation/tutorials` folder. There is also an option to download the tutorial notebooks on their own here [https://albert-dev.coldquanta.com/resources](https://albert-dev.coldquanta.com/resources)
+You can download a copy of our tutorial notebooks from our GitLab project located here: TODO
 
-To start up Jupyter and begin using the tutorial notebooks run the following command in the same directory as the notebook files:
+## Running Tutorial Notebooks
+
+To start up Jupyter and begin using the tutorial notebooks run the following command in the same directory as the notebook files you have downloaded:
 
 ```
 jupyter notebook
 ```
 
 - This will open a tab in your default web browser with a file explorer type interface.
 - Using this interface navigate to the location of the provided notebooks and select one to open.
 - This will open another tab with the contents of the selected notebook.
 - Each notebook has pre-populated examples you can then execute with instructions for each step
 - For a more detailed explanation of the Oqtant API refer to our [API Docs](oqtant_api_docs.md)
 
+If you run into `ModuleNotFound` errors when running cells within the notebooks it can be a sign that the notebooks are not using the correct version of python. To fix this close the notebook server, run the following, then restart the notebooks:
+
+```
+python -m ipykernel install --user
+```
+
 **Note: You may notice that each tutorial notebook has two files with different extensions (.ipynb and .md). The files you want to be using with Jupyter are the .ipynb files as these are what runs the underlying Oqtant python code. The .md files are static markdown representations of the tutorial notebooks that can be used as reference if needed. The .md files are safe to delete**
 
 ## Authentication
 
-At the top of each tutorial notebook you will see a step called `Sign into Albert`. This step is required for all notebook and client operations to ensure only authorized parties are accessing Albert.

 ## Capabilities
 
-- Access all the functionality of the Albert Web App (https://albert-dev.coldquanta.com)
+- Access all the functionality of the Oqtant Web App (https://albert-dev.coldquanta.com)
 
   - BARRIER (Barrier Manipulator) jobs

 ## How Oqtant Works
 
-- Construct a single or list of jobs using the AlbertJob class
+- Construct a single or list of jobs using the OqtantJob class
 
   - 1D parameter sweeps are supported
 
 - Run a single or list of jobs using run_jobs(). The jobs are submitted to run on hardware in FIFO queue.
 
   - job lists are run sequentially (uninterrupted) unless list exceeds 30 jobs
 
-- As jobs run, AlbertJob objects are created automatically and stored in active_jobs.
+- As jobs run, OqtantJob objects are created automatically and stored in active_jobs.
 
   - View these jobs with see_active_jobs()
   - These jobs are available until the python session ends.
 
 - To operate on jobs from a current or previous session, load them into active_jobs with
 
   - load_job_from_id(), load_job_from_id_list(), load_job_from_file(), load_job_from_file_list()
 
-- To analyze job objects and use Albert's job analysis library, reference the AlbertJob class documentation.

 ## Considerations
 
-- Oqtant cannot interact with jobs that have been deleted via the Albert Web App
+- Oqtant cannot interact with jobs that have been deleted via the Oqtant Web App
 
 - Job results and limits are restricted to the account used to authenticate the Oqtant client
 
 - All jobs that have been submitted will be processed even if the Oqtant client session is ended before they complete

Much like an _AlbertJob_ itself, these constituent primitives are programmatic objects in their own right and can be instantiated and manipulated outside of a job object. Although not shown explicitly in our simple job data structure above, both _optical_barriers_ and _lasers_ are lists containing _Barrier_ and _Laser_ objects, respectively. These objects will be explored below. You are likely already familiar with the structure of the _rf_evaporation_ data and how defining that data controls the evaporation to BEC in the experiment.

-Not all job types support every one of these data structures. For the basic BEC-type job above, we did not have data entries for barriers, the landscape, or lasers. BEC jobs, for instance, only support the rf_evaporation primitive. After all, the purpose of a BEC job is to keep things simple and just focus on the ability to tune the creation of the condensate. At the next level of complexity, BARRIER jobs support both _rf_evaporation_ and _optical_barriers_ but not "optical_landscape" or "lasers". What data structures are supported by different job types will become clear as those job types are created/used/submitted. As a preview, please refer to the following table.

 Every job input has exactly one constituent RfEvaporation object defined by the "rf_evaporation" data shown above. The behavior of this object controls the RF knife evaporation from an ultracold gas to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), as well as providing flexibility for applying RF fields during the experiment phase after the initial evaporation is complete. The evaporation stage results in a tradeoff between final atom number and temperature -- evaporating more deeply, signified by RF detuning values closer to 0, produces less atoms but at colder temperature (and correspondingly higher condensate fraction). Applying RF radiation during the experiment phase allows for hot atoms above some temperature, produced for example by rapid manipulation of optical barries or landscape potentials (explored below), to be removed the experiment -- a so-called "RF shield".
 
 It is important to note here that we adopt the convention that time = 0 refers to the _end_ of the evaporation period. As such, the initial evaporation to BEC, as defined by the object under current inspection, will involve negative (relative) times. In our trap, the entire evaporation cycle takes on the order of a second, and times are specified in ms, so we should see negative times as large as a few thousand ms.
 
 ### Construction
 
-Let us begin by constructing a stand-alone RfEvaporation object completely independently of any specific Albert job. We can create this object by either calling the constructor directly with the required data fields:

 Note that the resolution of the projected light optical system is on the order of 2 microns. Thus, _Barrier_ objects with small widths will all appear similar in reality (the experiment) even if they have different _shape_ settings.
 
 ### Exploring Barrier interpolation options
 
-A Barrier object's 'interpolation' style determines how the time-dependent position, height, and width are determined for intermediate times between the provided data points in the 'times_ms' list class member. At this time, the interpolation choice is _shared_ for all three time-dependent barrier parameters. Let us explore the effects of different interpolation choices by altering the time-dependent position of our barrier, to make it a little more interesting, and then plot the position over time for a few different interpolation choices.

 ## The Optical Landscape Object
 
-Another Albert job primitive is the (singular) 'OpticalLandscape' object. This construct is similar to the optical barriers list in the sense that it instructs the experiment to apply 1D optical potentials, in the form of painted blue-detuned light, to the condensate over the course of the experiment. However, now the user (you!) is free to specify a list of positions and corresponding potential energies at specified times, instead of being limited to the concept of a singular barrier or combination of multiple barriers.

 The OpticalLandscape object consists of a list of individual potential-energy landscapes and an interpolation option on how those landscapes connect together _in time_ (if there exists more than one underlying landscape). Let us begin by constructing a couple Landscape objects, from which we will compose the OpticalLandscape container object.
 
 ### Construction
 
 We can directly compose an _OpticalLandscape_ object, as above with the _Barrier_ object(s), or we can compose the constituent Landscape objects and then compose the full _OpticalLandscape_ object accordingly:

 ## ðŸ§­ Introduction
 
 This API contains tools to:
 
-- Access all the functionality of the Albert Web App (https://albert.coldquanta.com)
+- Access all the functionality of the Albert Web App (https://albert-dev.coldquanta.com)
 
   - BARRIER (Barrier Manipulator) jobs
   - BEC (Ultracold Matter) jobs
 
-- Build parameterized (i.e. optimization) experiments using AlbertJobs
+- Build parameterized (i.e. optimization) experiments using OqtantJobs
 
-- Submit and retrieve AlbertJob results
+- Submit and retrieve OqtantJob results
 
 ## ðŸ¤– How Oqtant Works
 
-- Construct a single or list of jobs using the AlbertJob class
+- Construct a single or list of jobs using the OqtantJob class
 
   - 1D parameter sweeps are supported
 
 - Run a single or list of jobs using run_jobs(). The jobs are submitted to run on hardware in FIFO queue.
 
   - job lists are run sequentially (uninterrupted) unless list exceeds 30 jobs
 
-- As jobs run, AlbertJob objects are created automatically and stored in active_jobs.
+- As jobs run, OqtantJob objects are created automatically and stored in active_jobs.
 
   - View these jobs with see_active_jobs()
   - These jobs are available until the python session ends.
 
 - To operate on jobs from a current or previous session, load them into active_jobs with
 
   - load_job_from_id(), load_job_from_id_list(), load_job_from_file(), load_job_from_file_list()
 
-- To analyze job objects and use Albert's job analysis library, reference the AlbertJob class documentation.
+- To analyze job objects and use Oqtant's job analysis library, reference the OqtantJob class documentation.
