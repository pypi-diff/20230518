-        [![PyPi release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/garminexport.svg)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/garminexport.svg)
-        ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/garminexport)
-        ![PyPI - License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/garminexport)
-        
-        # About
-        `garminexport` is both a library and a utility script for downloading/backing up
-        [Garmin Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/) activities to a local disk.
-        
-        The main utility script is called `garmin-backup` and performs incremental
-        backups of your Garmin account to a local directory. The first time
-        `garmin-backup` is run, it will download *all* activities. After that, it will
-        do incremental backups of your account. That is, the script will only download
-        activities that haven't already been downloaded to the backup directory.
-        
-        
-        # Installation
-        `garminexport` is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) and can be installed
-        with [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org):
-        
-            pip install garminexport
-        
-        It requires Python 3.5+.
-        
-        
-        # Usage
-        
-        
-        ## Prerequisites
-        To be of any use you need to register an account at [Garmin
-        Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/) and populate it with some activities.
-        
-        
-        ## As a command-line tool (garmin-backup)
-        
-        The backup program is run as follows (use the `--help` flag for a full list of
-        available options):
-        
-            garmin-backup --backup-dir=activities <username or email>
-        
-        Once started, the program will prompt you for your account password and then log
-        in to your Garmin Connect account to download activities to the specified backup
-        directory on your machine. The program will only download activities that aren't
-        already in the backup directory.
-        
-        Activities can be exported in any of the formats outlined below. Note that
-        by default, the program downloads all formats for every activity. Use the
-        `--format` option to narrow the selection.
-        
-        Supported export formats:
-        
-        
-          -   `gpx`: activity GPX file (XML).
-        
-              <sub>[GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) is an open
-              format, mainly for storing GPS routes/tracks. It does support extensions
-              and Garmin appears to annotate the GPS data with, for example, heart-rate
-              and cadence, when available on your device.</sub>
-        
-          -   `tcx`: an activity TCX file (XML).
-              *Note: a `.tcx` file may not always be possible to export, for example
-              if an activity was uploaded in gpx format. In that case, Garmin won't try
-              to synthesize a tcx file.*
-        
-              <sub>[TCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Center_XML) (Training
-              Center XML) is Garmin's own XML format. It is, essentially, an extension
-              of GPX which includes more metrics and divides the GPS track into "laps"
-              as recorded by your device (with "lap summaries" for each metric).</sub>
-        
-          -   `fit`: activity FIT file (binary format).
-              *Note: a `.fit` file may not always be possible to export, for example
-              if an activity was entered manually rather than imported from a Garmin device.*
-        
-              <sub>The [FIT](https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/) format is the
-              "raw data type" stored in your Garmin device and should contain all
-              metrics your device is capable of tracking (GPS, heart rate, cadence,
-              etc). It's a binary format, so tools are needed to read its content.</sub>
-        
-          -   `json_summary`: activity summary file (JSON).
-        
-              <sub>Provides summary data for an activity. Seems to lack a formal schema
-              and should not be counted on as a stable data format (it may change at any
-              time). Only included since it *may* contain additional data that could be
-              useful for developers of analysis tools.</sub>
-        
-          -   `json_details`: activity details file (JSON).
-        
-              <sub>Provides detailed activity data in a JSON format. Seems to lack a
-              formal schema and should not be counted on as a stable data format (it may
-              change at any time). Only included since it *may* contain additional data
-              that could be useful for developers of analysis tools.</sub>
-        
-        All files are written to the same directory (`activities/` by default).  Each
-        activity file is prefixed by its upload timestamp and its activity id.
-        
-        
-        `garminexport` also contains a few smaller utility programs:
-        
-        - `garmin-get-activity`: download a single Garmin Connect activity. Run with
-          `--help`for more details.
-        - `garmin-upload-activity`: uplad a single Garmin Connect activity file (`.fit`,
-          `.gpx`, or `.tcx`). Run with `--help`for more details.
-        
-        
-        ## As a library
-        
-        To build your own tools around the Garmin Connect API you can import the
-        `garminclient` module. It handles authentication to establish a secure session
-        with Garmin Connect. For example use, have a look at the command-line tools
-        under [garminexport/cli](garminexport/cli).
-        
-        
-        # Contribute
-        
-        To work on the code base you need (besides the basic prerequisites outlined
-        above) to have [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) installed.  Create a
-        `virtualenv` (an isolated development environment) and install the required
-        dependencies like so:
-        
-        
-            make venv
-            # or similarly: pipenv install
-

+
+# About
+
+`garminexport` is both a library and a tool for downloading/backing up [Garmin
+Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/) activities to a local disk.
+
+The main utility script is called `garmin-backup` and performs incremental
+backups of your Garmin account to a local directory. The first time
+`garmin-backup` is run, it will download *all* activities. After that, it will
+do incremental backups of your account. That is, the script will only download
+activities that haven't already been downloaded to the backup directory.
+
+
+# Installation
+
+`garminexport` is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) and can be installed
+with [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org):
+
+``` bash
+pip install garminexport
+```
+
+To install `garminexport` with support to circumvent Cloudflare's bot protection
+(which has been known to impact some users) you can install the module with the
+`cloudflare`
+[extra](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/dependency_management.html#optional-dependencies) like so:
+
+``` bash
+pip install garminexport[cloudflare]
+```
+
+This replaces the default [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) library
+with [cloudscraper](https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper) for HTTP request.
+
+# Usage
+
+## Prerequisites
+To be of any use you need to register an account at [Garmin
+Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/) and populate it with some activities.
+
+
+## As a command-line tool (garmin-backup)
+
+The backup program is run as follows (use the `--help` flag for a full list of
+available options):
+
+``` bash
+garmin-backup --backup-dir=activities <username or email>
+```
+
+Once started, the program will prompt you for your account password and then log
+in to your Garmin Connect account to download activities to the specified backup
+directory on your machine. The program will only download activities that aren't
+already in the backup directory.
+
+Activities can be exported in any of the formats outlined below. Note that
+by default, the program downloads all formats for every activity. Use the
+`--format` option to narrow the selection.
+
+Supported export formats:
+
+
+  -   `gpx`: activity GPX file (XML).
+
+      <sub>[GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) is an open
+      format, mainly for storing GPS routes/tracks. It does support extensions
+      and Garmin appears to annotate the GPS data with, for example, heart-rate
+      and cadence, when available on your device.</sub>
+
+  -   `tcx`: an activity TCX file (XML).
+      *Note: a `.tcx` file may not always be possible to export, for example
+      if an activity was uploaded in gpx format. In that case, Garmin won't try
+      to synthesize a tcx file.*
+
+      <sub>[TCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Center_XML) (Training
+      Center XML) is Garmin's own XML format. It is, essentially, an extension
+      of GPX which includes more metrics and divides the GPS track into "laps"
+      as recorded by your device (with "lap summaries" for each metric).</sub>
+
+  -   `fit`: activity FIT file (binary format).
+      *Note: a `.fit` file may not always be possible to export, for example
+      if an activity was entered manually rather than imported from a Garmin device.*
+
+      <sub>The [FIT](https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/) format is the
+      "raw data type" stored in your Garmin device and should contain all
+      metrics your device is capable of tracking (GPS, heart rate, cadence,
+      etc). It's a binary format, so tools are needed to read its content.</sub>
+
+  -   `json_summary`: activity summary file (JSON).
+
+      <sub>Provides summary data for an activity. Seems to lack a formal schema
+      and should not be counted on as a stable data format (it may change at any
+      time). Only included since it *may* contain additional data that could be
+      useful for developers of analysis tools.</sub>
+
+  -   `json_details`: activity details file (JSON).
+
+      <sub>Provides detailed activity data in a JSON format. Seems to lack a
+      formal schema and should not be counted on as a stable data format (it may
+      change at any time). Only included since it *may* contain additional data
+      that could be useful for developers of analysis tools.</sub>
+
+All files are written to the same directory (`activities/` by default).  Each
+activity file is prefixed by its upload timestamp and its activity id.
+
+`garminexport` also contains a few smaller utility programs:
+
+- `garmin-get-activity`: download a single Garmin Connect activity. Run with
+  `--help`for more details.
+- `garmin-upload-activity`: uplad a single Garmin Connect activity file (`.fit`,
+  `.gpx`, or `.tcx`). Run with `--help`for more details.
+
+## As a library
+
+To build your own tools around the Garmin Connect API you can import the
+`garminclient` module. It handles authentication to establish a secure session
+with Garmin Connect. For example use, have a look at the command-line tools
+under [garminexport/cli](garminexport/cli).
+
+For example, in your `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml` ([PEP
+631](https://peps.python.org/pep-0631/)) add something like:
+
+``` python
+install_requires=[
+    'garminexport',
+    # also installs 'cloudscraper' as a dependency
+    # 'garminexport[cloudflare]',
+    ...
+]
+```
+
+Note: if you happen to have
+[cloudscraper](https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper) on your `PACKAGEPATH`
+`GarminClient` will make use of it whenever it needs to make an HTTP request.
+
+# Contribute
+
+To work on the code base you need (besides the basic prerequisites outlined
+above) to have [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) installed.  Create a
+`virtualenv` (an isolated development environment) and install the required
+dependencies like so:
+
+
+    make venv
+    # or similarly: pipenv install
+
+
```

+`garminexport` is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) and can be installed
+with [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org):
+
+``` bash
+pip install garminexport
+```
+
+To install `garminexport` with support to circumvent Cloudflare's bot protection
+(which has been known to impact some users) you can install the module with the
+`cloudflare`
+[extra](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/dependency_management.html#optional-dependencies) like so:
+
+``` bash
+pip install garminexport[cloudflare]
+```
+
+This replaces the default [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) library
+with [cloudscraper](https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper) for HTTP request.
+
+# Usage
+
+## Prerequisites
+To be of any use you need to register an account at [Garmin
+Connect](http://connect.garmin.com/) and populate it with some activities.
+
+
+## As a command-line tool (garmin-backup)
+
+The backup program is run as follows (use the `--help` flag for a full list of
+available options):
+
+``` bash
+garmin-backup --backup-dir=activities <username or email>
+```
+
+Once started, the program will prompt you for your account password and then log
+in to your Garmin Connect account to download activities to the specified backup
+directory on your machine. The program will only download activities that aren't
+already in the backup directory.
+
+Activities can be exported in any of the formats outlined below. Note that
+by default, the program downloads all formats for every activity. Use the
+`--format` option to narrow the selection.
+
+Supported export formats:
+
+
+  -   `gpx`: activity GPX file (XML).
+
+      <sub>[GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) is an open
+      format, mainly for storing GPS routes/tracks. It does support extensions
+      and Garmin appears to annotate the GPS data with, for example, heart-rate
+      and cadence, when available on your device.</sub>
+
+  -   `tcx`: an activity TCX file (XML).
+      *Note: a `.tcx` file may not always be possible to export, for example
+      if an activity was uploaded in gpx format. In that case, Garmin won't try
+      to synthesize a tcx file.*
+
+      <sub>[TCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Center_XML) (Training
+      Center XML) is Garmin's own XML format. It is, essentially, an extension
+      of GPX which includes more metrics and divides the GPS track into "laps"
+      as recorded by your device (with "lap summaries" for each metric).</sub>
+
+  -   `fit`: activity FIT file (binary format).
+      *Note: a `.fit` file may not always be possible to export, for example
+      if an activity was entered manually rather than imported from a Garmin device.*
+
+      <sub>The [FIT](https://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit/) format is the
+      "raw data type" stored in your Garmin device and should contain all
+      metrics your device is capable of tracking (GPS, heart rate, cadence,
+      etc). It's a binary format, so tools are needed to read its content.</sub>
+
+  -   `json_summary`: activity summary file (JSON).
+
+      <sub>Provides summary data for an activity. Seems to lack a formal schema
+      and should not be counted on as a stable data format (it may change at any
+      time). Only included since it *may* contain additional data that could be
+      useful for developers of analysis tools.</sub>
+
+  -   `json_details`: activity details file (JSON).
+
+      <sub>Provides detailed activity data in a JSON format. Seems to lack a
+      formal schema and should not be counted on as a stable data format (it may
+      change at any time). Only included since it *may* contain additional data
+      that could be useful for developers of analysis tools.</sub>
+
+All files are written to the same directory (`activities/` by default).  Each
+activity file is prefixed by its upload timestamp and its activity id.
+
+`garminexport` also contains a few smaller utility programs:
+
+- `garmin-get-activity`: download a single Garmin Connect activity. Run with
+  `--help`for more details.
+- `garmin-upload-activity`: uplad a single Garmin Connect activity file (`.fit`,
+  `.gpx`, or `.tcx`). Run with `--help`for more details.
+
+## As a library
+
+To build your own tools around the Garmin Connect API you can import the
+`garminclient` module. It handles authentication to establish a secure session
+with Garmin Connect. For example use, have a look at the command-line tools
+under [garminexport/cli](garminexport/cli).
+
+For example, in your `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml` ([PEP
+631](https://peps.python.org/pep-0631/)) add something like:
+
+``` python
+install_requires=[
+    'garminexport',
+    # also installs 'cloudscraper' as a dependency
+    # 'garminexport[cloudflare]',
+    ...
+]
+```
+
+Note: if you happen to have
+[cloudscraper](https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper) on your `PACKAGEPATH`
+`GarminClient` will make use of it whenever it needs to make an HTTP request.
+
+# Contribute
+
+To work on the code base you need (besides the basic prerequisites outlined
+above) to have [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) installed.  Create a
+`virtualenv` (an isolated development environment) and install the required
+dependencies like so:
+
+
+    make venv
+    # or similarly: pipenv install
+
+
```
